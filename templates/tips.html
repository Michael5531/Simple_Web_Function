       <strong><p>Staing on track</p></strong>
        <p>The University of Sydney enables you to undertake a "Staying on Track" program which allows you to help realise the implications of certain study habits that would eventually lead you to occassionally failing assessments. By doing so this helps you by working out a plan of action which you could take to deal with these issues.

</p>
        <strong><p>Study Tips</p></strong>
        <p>Allow yourself enough time to study and always start projects and assignments as soon as possible. By doing so, you will be able to spend large amounts of time understanding the logic of your assignments and less time debugging your code.</p>

        <p>Start off with flow charts and diagrams. Spend a bit of time drawing flow charts and diagrams for confusing problems. Visual aids not only help you when revising but they also allow you to see the control and logic flow of your programs and will definitely help the logic of your programs.</p>

<p>Develop your own support system and study with a group with the same interests as yourself. Not only does working with others sharpen your skills through the sharing of interesting and different ideas, you will be able to improve notes, get help with difficult problems and concepts, review other's code for errors and most importantly, make learning fun!</p>
